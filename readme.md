# Chinese Metaphor Corpus
There is no public Chinese metaphor corpus avaiable so far. This made some researches of Chinese metaphor is hard to begin, expecially whose neural approaches which need sufficient training dataset. We decide to break this restriction. We annotate 6000+ sentences manually, each sentence has one label: "is metaphor" or "not metaphor".
